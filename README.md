# The Survis Game
The Survis Game is a simulator designed as a playful and educational tool for teaching animal adaptation across all age groups. 
It illustrates key biological concepts such as evolutionary trade-offs, ecosystem balance, reproductive strategies, and predator–prey dynamics in an interactive and intuitive way.

The game is ideally facilitated by a teacher, encouraging collaboration, decision-making, creativity, and critical reflection. During the game, participants design small arthropod-like species called “Survis”, which move, compete for resources, reproduce, and evolve over five rounds within a shared environment.

## 🎮 Game Overview
Players are organized into groups, each receiving a fixed number of points. These points are used to design their Survi by selecting different traits and abilities, forcing players to make strategic trade-offs.

## 🧩 Game objectives
_Competitive:_
Build the most successful Survi and dominate the shared habitat against other Survis.

_Cooperative:_
Collaborate to design a balanced ecosystem of prey and predators, aiming for long-term ecological stability.
