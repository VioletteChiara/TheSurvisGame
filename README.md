# The Survis Game

The Survis Game was developed for the Semana de la Ciencia at the University of León.
It is an educational simulation in which players create small arthropod-like organisms (“Survis”) that grow, reproduce, and compete for resources.

## 🎮 Game Overview
Each group of players (e.g., children in a workshop) receives a fixed number of points.
These points are used to design their ideal Survi, choosing different traits and abilities.

Once created, the Survis enter the simulation, where they:
- Compete for resources
- Grow and reproduce
- Interact with other players’ Survis

## 🧩 Game objectives
_Competitive:_
Build the most successful Survi and see how it performs against others.

_Cooperative:_
Work together to design a balanced ecosystem with prey and predators, aiming for long-term stability.

## 🧠 Educational Objectives

The Survis Game can be used to illustrate several key biological concepts:
- Adaptation and competition
- Evolutionary trade-offs
- Ecosystem balance
- Reproductive strategies
- Predator–prey dynamics
